	    If you are an Indian bride who plans to wear a traditional Sari or 
		Lehenga of red, maroon, gold or green colors, you may also want to 
		consider wearing Indian bridal makeup. Traditionally, Indian bridal 
		makeup takes in the whole person and consists of 16 items including 
		the dress. These items are known as the Solah Shringar of the bride.</br>
<br>Traditional Indian Bridal Makeup :
The Solah Shringar holds many symbolic aspects for the Indian bride. 
Tikka bindi are traditionally a red dot worn at the center of the 
forehead dropping to the center of the brow. This is a symbol of 
femininity and marriage and represents good omens and purity. 
Bridal bindi are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
These ornamental bindi can be decorated with mirror, rings, bells,
beads and more.</br>
<br>Solah Shringar include bridal jewelry:
<br>•	Nose ring: The nose ring known as a Nath is a traditional piece of bridal jewelry.
<br>•	Jhumka: Earings
<br>•	Mangalsutra: A necklace worn by a married woman designed with a combination of black and gold beads.
<br>•	Payal: A fine chain worn around the ankle and decorated with ornamental, small bells.
<br>•	Bichua: A toe ring worn on the second toe.
<br>•	Choodi: Bangles worn on the wrist as a sign of marriage.
<br>•	Kamarband: A bridal waist ornament that holds the bridal sari in place.
<br>•	Pocha's: A bridal hand ornament.
<br>•	Angouti: The ring-just like in Western cultures is the symbol of love and commitment.
<br>•	Bazubandh: An ornament worn on the upper arm.
