MAC Pro Longwear Foundation Review
The MAC Pro Longwear foundation is indeed long-wearing as per its claims. It looked just as fresh even
after a long 12-hour day. It gives your skin a beautiful, natural finish. The coverage is buildable, and 
it’s great for regular use as it’s quite lightweight and does not clog pores. Coming to the texture, this 
liquid foundation is just the right amount of creamy. It does not transfer and stays on all day long. If you
have acne prone skin and need to cover blemishes, this does a brilliant job.</br>
