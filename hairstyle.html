		<font size="5" face="lucida fax" color="red">
		<br>When it comes to fancy hair, you should either go big or go home.
		And this hairstyle definitely goes big with its elaborate ringlet
		bun and a big flower to add that oomph-factor that you are looking for.</br>
<br>What You Need :
<br>•	Texturizing spray
<br>•	Thin hair elastics
<br>•	Bobby pins
<br>•	Strong hold hairspray
<br>•	A big flower</br>
<br>How To Style :</br>
<br>1. Prep your washed, dried hair with some texturizing spray.</br>
<br>2. Pick up half of your hair from the top and French braid it till 
       you reach the top of your ears, then secure it with a hair elastic.</br>
<br>3. Leaving aside the hair from your French braid, pick up the rest of 
       your hair and tie a simple bun, making sure to place it off center.</br>
<br>4. Pick up a 1 inch section of hair from the hair left under your French 
       braid, roll it into a ringlet, and secure it onto the bun using bobby pins.</br>
<br>5. Repeat the previous step until all the hair from the French braid has been 
       pinned to the bun.</br>
<br>6. Attach a big flower next to your bun using bobby pins.</br>
<br>7. Finish off the look with a few spritzes of strong hold hairspray.</br>
